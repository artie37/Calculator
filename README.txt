Calculator

This is a simple calculator that adds, subtracts, multiplies and divides.

Instructions:
	The first value entered is required to be a number. This number can be an int or double. 

	The next value to be entered is the operation the user wishes to perform (e.g. '+', '-', '*', '/'). 
	
	The next value to be entered is another number to perform the operation. An answer will be displayed when the user presses enter.

	The user can type "clear" to set the total equal to 0 and "quit" to end the program.
	
	After completing an operation, the user can enter just a number to perform the previous operation on the total.

Known Bugs:
	 If an empty string is entered, the program crashes.
